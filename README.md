# Data-Visualization-NYC-311
This project uses Tableau to visualize the impact of Covid on the New York City's 311 service.

Technical Skills:

Python, Google BigQuery, Tableau, Tableau Prep, Data Cleaning, Visualization

Project Type: Academic project for the course IE6600 – Computation and Visualization

Project Duration: 3 months (October 2022 - December 2022)

Project Description:

This project was focused on visualizing New York City's 3-1-1 service request data to assess the impact of COVID-19 on city services and to facilitate better municipal complaint management. Our objectives were to create an interactive dashboard highlighting complaint patterns and to provide insights into the efficiency of city agencies during the pandemic.

Data and Preprocessing:

We analyzed over 31 million NYC 3-1-1 service requests from 2010 to the present, utilizing datasets publicly available via NYC Open Data’s Socrata API. The challenge of processing such a vast dataset was met by employing Google BigQuery for data filtration and reduction, and Tableau Prep for visualization preparation. The data cleaning process involved removing irrelevant columns, handling null values, and reducing the dataset from its original size to a more manageable form with 25 columns and 12 million records.

Exploratory Data Analysis:

Using Tableau, we conducted an exploratory analysis to understand the distribution of complaints across different boroughs and to identify the most common types of complaints. This phase was crucial for designing our dashboards to answer specific research questions about the impact of COVID-19 on service request volumes and the efficiency of city agencies.

Modeling and Evaluation:

Our analysis did not involve predictive modeling but focused on visualization and interpretation of the data. We created two main dashboards: one to explore the overall distribution and response times of various complaint types before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and another to investigate specific questions regarding the impact of COVID-19 on service request volumes and city agency efficiency.

Key Insights:

Our visualizations revealed significant insights into the nature of 3-1-1 service requests, the impact of COVID-19 on complaint volumes, and the efficiency of city agencies in responding to these complaints. We found that the pandemic influenced both the types of complaints and the response times, highlighting the resilience and adaptability of New York City's service infrastructure.

Conclusion:

The project successfully achieved its goal of creating an interactive dashboard to visualize NYC 3-1-1 service request data. Our findings offer valuable insights for city planners and public officials to improve municipal services and prepare for future crises.

Future Scope:

Further studies could include predictive modeling to forecast complaint volumes and the development of a more dynamic dashboard that incorporates real-time data updates. Additionally, incorporating machine learning techniques could enhance the predictive accuracy and offer deeper insights into service request trends.
